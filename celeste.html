			<h1>Now that we know the basics of Astronomy, let us start using it!</h1>
				<h2>The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere, at which Earth is at the center. This sphere is so big, that the Earth is a small dot within it. On the sphere, is the projection of the stars. As seen from Earth.
					How can one find their position in the world with this? What should we look out for? Seems impossible!!
				</h2>
			<h1> So how can we do this?</h1>
				<h2> While there are many ways for us to position ourselves. We will only focus on our position latitude wise as it is the easiest. But the same idea applies to positioning longitude wise. So let us begin.</h2>

			<h1>Big Dipper</h1>
				<h2> In this above picture, the big sauce pan looking constellation is called the Big Dipper. Finding it is fairly easy since the constellation is very bright. You should count 7 stars in total. If you miltiply the distance between the right side of the sauce pan
					6 times in the direction of the distance, you will find Polaris. This will tell you where North is. From there, you can head East or West.
				</h2>
			
			<h1>How does this help us?</h1>
				<h2> If we have the tools, or just eyeball it, we can find the angle of Polaris aboce the horizon. This tells us our latitude on Earth. Very Convenient. Montreal's latitude is 44.5N. That means that Polaris will be found at an angle of 44.5 degrees from the horizon
					If you are ever on a ship and need to know if you are on course, Polaris is made just for that.</h2>

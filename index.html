			<h1>What is Astronomy?</h1>
				<h2>Astronomy is the study of celestial objects, objects that are not on Earth. Not to be confused with Astrology, the study of forcasting human events.</h2>
			<h1> What will you gain out of this website?</h1>
				<h2>The field of Astronomy is so vast that this website will barely even scratch the surface of this field. However, what this website will allow you to do
					is give you a strong foundation of the basics, and a strong history lesson. After finishing browsing this website, you should be able to recall the discoveries of the Greeks,
					the old universal model that was used for 14 centuries, the story of Galileo and his discovering, and subsequent encounter with the law, and finally, celestial navigation.
					While this may seem like a lot, the website is formatted in a way to give you all the information you need in chunks.
				</h2>
			<h1>What this website won't do</h1>
				<h2>This website will not include any heavy math. As thus, most information here is trivial. This means you can't use this website to provide you with calculations. This website will also not delve into the wonders
					of recent Astronomy. This sadly means no talking about the James Webb Space Telescope, or how we got into the moon, or how to get to other planets for that matter.
				</h2>
			<h1> With all the disclaimers out of the way, enjoy your journey into the history of Astronomy</h1>
